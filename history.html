      <h3>What do you think of when anyone says "Mac and Cheese?" Is it your grandmother's classic cheddar home recipe? Or your brother's gourmet twist with garlic breadcrumbs? Do you associate it with classic Americana cuisine or of another culture? Mac and Cheese is more than just a meal - it's a lifestyle. Here at Cheesology we understand that. And we hope to shed a little bit more light on the cheesey history of the food staple we can all love.</h3>
      <br>
      <h4>Arguably the first Mac and Cheese recipe recorded, the infamous 14th century Medieval cookbook, "Forme of Cury," stated "Take and make a thynne foyle of dowh. and kerve it on peces, and cast hem on boillyng water & see√æ it wele. take chese and grate it and butter cast bynethen and above as losyns. and serue forth" - a far cry from the Kraft Box of the 21st century! Originally considered a pasta dish in Italy, it was brought over to England in the 14th century and then gained traction in North America through an 1824 appearance in "The Virginia Housewife." From there Macaroni and Cheese spread throughout the States - gaining regional flavors and accents. Indeed July 14th is National Macaroni and Cheese day in the USA and can be seen in such innovative forms as macaroni pizza, burgers and quiche. At Cheesology we maintain the basic form but throw out all the other rules - gouda, parmesan, blue cheese, cheddar acting as the glue and pork, bbq sauce, and artichoke hearts acting as the surprises hidden in the middle. So come to Cheesology and see how far we can push the Mac and Cheese envelope! </h4>
